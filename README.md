# AutoDev: Automated Software Development System

AutoDev is a multi-agent system designed to automate the software development lifecycle. It uses AI-powered agents to handle different aspects of software development, from initial project setup to deployment.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents handle different aspects of development
- **AI-Powered Development**: Leverages LLMs for code generation and decision making
- **Automated Testing**: Automatic test generation and execution
- **CI/CD Integration**: Built-in support for continuous integration and deployment
- **Service Integration**: Works with GitHub, Render, and Docker

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autodev.git
cd autodev
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Usage

1. Start a new project:
```python
from autodev import AutoDev

# Initialize the system
autodev = AutoDev()

# Start a new project
project = autodev.create_project(
    name="My Project",
    description="A sample project"
)

# Run the development pipeline
autodev.run(project)
```

2. Monitor progress:
```python
# Get project status
status = project.get_status()

# Get development logs
logs = project.get_logs()
```

## Architecture

The system uses a swarm of specialized agents:

- **User Interface Agent**: Handles user interactions and project initialization
- **Project Manager Agent**: Coordinates development activities
- **Task Decomposer Agent**: Breaks down projects into manageable tasks
- **Developer Agent**: Generates and reviews code
- **Testing Agent**: Creates and runs tests
- **Integration Agent**: Handles code integration
- **Deployment Agent**: Manages deployment to production
